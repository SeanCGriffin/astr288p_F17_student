I will be using a shell script to collect the homework assignments from these directories.

Questions 1 and 2 can be answered as comments in the the script you need to write for Question 3.

## Questions

1. What is a shell script? **(1)**

2. How does the command line know which language (bash, tcsh, pyton, etc.) to use to execute a script? **(1)**

3. Using variables, write a **bash** shell script that prints the following to the screen **(8 total points)**: 
    * *Your* username **(1)**
    * The username of the person running the script **(1)**
    * The current date and time **(1)**
    * The name of the computer on which the script is being run **(1)**
    * How long the comuter that is running the script has been running (hint: There is a simple Linux command for this) **(1)**
    * The interpreter (command line) must know that this is a bash script.

Please provide your code as a \<your\_username\>_hw01.sh file for which you have given all users read and execute permission **(1)**. 
Also, give an example of the output of the code as seen when run on your machine in a text file \<username\>_hw01.log **(1)**. 
Include the terminal command used to pipe (hint!) the output to screen and to the log file; provide this as a comment at the **end** of the log file. **(1)**

You may need to look up the names of some of the required variables as they are not guarunteed to be in the course notes (there are too many to list!).
