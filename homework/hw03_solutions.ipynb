    "\n",
    "The USS Voyager was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, some 70,000 light years away after being taken there by an entity known as the Caretaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "Voyager was equipped with a state-of-the-art warp drive capable of a maximum warp factor of 9.975 and a cruising warp of 6.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert Warp to speed using the following equation: \n",
    "$$ \\frac{v}{c} = W^{\\frac{10}{3}} $$\n",
    "where $c$ is the speed of light. \n",
    "To get a value for $c$, use the scipy.constants module (look it up!). You may need to do a conda install scipy in order to import this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function that takes a warp factor as an argument and returns a velocity in $m/s$, and another that takes light years as an argument an returns meters (so that your units match) and then calculate the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. (2 marks) Make a plot of warp factor versus velocity for Warp 1 - Warp 9\n",
    "1. (1 marks) How long would it take in for Voyager to reach Earth assuming a mean speed of Warp 6.5? Give your answer in years.\n",
    "1. (1 marks) What about at maximum warp? \n",
    "1. (2 marks): The original Enterprise (NX-01) could go to \"Neptune and back in six minutes\". Assuming Earth as the starting point, how fast was the Enterprise going in m/s and in Warp units? \n",
    "1. (4 marks): Your program must be able to detect if an incorrect Warp Factor is given. Only Warp Factors $0 <= W < 10$ are valid. If an incorrect warp factor is passed to your program it must **raise** a **ValueError**. There is some information on this in the Lecture 4 notes, but you should also do some reading on-line about how to do this correctly. "
