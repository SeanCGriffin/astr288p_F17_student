    "We discussed briefly in class Gaussian and Poisson distributions. Shot noise (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise)) is an example of random noise that is governed by a Poisson process. \n",

    "The function defined below returns the probability $P$ of receiveing $k$ noise photons given a background photon rate of $\\lambda$ photons/second and a time period $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'background' flux of the night sky can be modeled as Poissonian noise; under dark skies, the night sky background has a flux of roughly \n",
    "$$F_0 = 3\\times10^{12}~\\mathrm{photons/ s/ m^2/ sr}$$\n",
    "in the regime relevant to ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. These telescopes look at very bright but very quick (10s of nanoseconds) long flashes of light. In order to 'trigger' on and save these flashes, these telescopes require a certain numbr of photons (the *trigger threshold*) to arrive within some period of time known as the *trigger window*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a collection area of $100~\\mathrm{m}^2$, a field of view of $\\sim 2\\times10^{-6}~\\mathrm{sr}$, and assuming that the telescope sensor detects only 30% of all photons, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the telescope trigger requires 5 photons to be seen in a 10ns window, what is the probability that the trigger will be random noise? \n",
    "1. Plot the probability as a function of number of photons ($k$) for three different night sky background values: $F_0$, $5F_0$, and $10F_0$ (corresponding to roughly new moon, and different amounts of moonlight). Plot your results from $k=0$ to $k=30$ photons.\n",
    "1. Demonstrate that as you narrow the trigger window (i.e. require a smaller $\\Delta t$ for arriving photons) the probability of getting a given number of photons decreases by plotting the Poisson probability as a function of trigger window. Do this for $k=3,5,10$. **Hint** This can be made simple by choosing a fixed trigger threshold and changing the trigger window $\\Delta t$. \n",
