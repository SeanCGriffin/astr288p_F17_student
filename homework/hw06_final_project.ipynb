    "There will be in in-class presentation and discussion on the cases. The way the marking breakdown will be as follows:\n",
    " - Homework 6: Pass / Fail: Make your slides using **LaTeX** and **beamer**. \n",
    " - Presentation: 25% of project grade.\n",
    " - Notebook (see below): 75% of project grade.\n",

    "Your presentation is 10 minutes (which includes question, so perhaps prepare 5 minutes of show and tell). This will be strictly timed so that everyone has a chance to present. The notebook however should tell the whole story. \n",

    "This homework is **due on December 8, at noon** so I can prepare the lecture while you show your results a few hours later.\n",

    "You will need to submit:\n",
    "1. Your latex slides .tex file submitted as <username>_hw06.tex\n",
    "1. Your ipython notebook submitted as <username>_hw06.ipynb, as per usual.\n",

You can also use the full text search button in the top right, and browse through the results that way. For example you could search for \"python\" or \"cosmology\"...\n",

    "If you chose non-Python software, it will obviously be harder to explain using a notebook. That should not stop you from using a non-python code. In those cases use some Markdown cells to document your work, so I can in principle reproduce your results. \n",
